# CMPE-256_Asgn2_Feature-Engineering-Unstructured-Data

Ask : Purpose of the assignment is to derive feature engineering spectrograms of wave files:

Display a spectrogram/chromagram/cqt/etc.
Compute a mel-scaled spectrogram
Short-time Fourier transform (STFT).
beat tracker 
and Compute the constant-Q transform of an audio signal.

Please extract following features of the Car NASA (you can download from https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/features/halloween_sounds.htmlLinks to an external site.).

Kepler: Star KIC12268220C Light Curve Waves to Sound
NASA - Kepler: Star KIC7671081B Light Curve Waves to
NASA - Whistler Waves
Johns Hopkins APL - Parker Solar Probe - Whistler Mode Waves 2
NASA - Audio from NASAâ€™s Juno Mission: Europa Flyby

Solution:

Using the provided reference files and In Class Demo Files on wave features, have created the feature engineering Spectograms of the audio files. All the code is checked in to github and please find below the screenshots of the Spectograms generated for the audio file : Kepler: Star KIC12268220C Light Curve Waves to Sound
